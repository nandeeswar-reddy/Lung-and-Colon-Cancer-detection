## üß¨ Project Overview

Lung and colon cancers are among the deadliest and most common forms of cancer globally. Early detection significantly increases survival rates‚Äîbut traditional diagnostic methods are labor-intensive and error-prone.

This project harnesses the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and medical image processing to automatically classify histopathological images into **benign or malignant** categories for **lung** and **colon** tissue samples.

> ‚öïÔ∏è Powered by deep learning, this model aids pathologists in making faster, more accurate diagnoses.

## üì∑ Dataset Description

The dataset includes histopathological image slides of **lung** and **colon** tissues. Each image is labeled as:

- **Benign** (non-cancerous)
- **Malignant** (cancerous)

### üîç Sample Categories:
- **Lung_Adenocarcinoma**
- **Lung_Squamous_Cell_Carcinoma**
- **Colon_Adenocarcinoma**
- **Colon_Benign_Tissue**

## üß† Model Architecture

This project uses a custom CNN architecture built from scratch with the following layers:

- Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling Layers for spatial reduction
- Fully Connected Dense Layers
- Softmax Output Layer for classification

The model is trained using **categorical cross-entropy loss**, **Adam optimizer**, and evaluated using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.

## üìä Performance

After training on lung and colon cancer images, the model achieved:

| Tissue Type | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| Lung | 97.6% |
| Colon | 98.3% |
| Combined | 98.0% |

Confusion matrices, training plots, and sample predictions are available in the notebook for visual insight.
